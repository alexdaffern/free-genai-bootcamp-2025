## Architectural/Design Considerations
### Requirements, Risks, Assumptions, & Constraints:
#### Requirements are the specific needs or capabilities that the architecture must meet or support.
Categories:

- Business Requirements: Business goals and objectives
- Functional Requirements: Specific capabilities the system must have
- Non-functional Requirements: Performance, scalability, security & useability
- Tooling: GenAI vs ML

Risks are potential events or conditions that could negatively affect the success of the architecture or its implementation. Identifying and mitigating risks ensures smoother project delivery.

Assumptions are things considered to be true without proof at the time of planning and development. These are necessary for decision-making but can introduce risks if proven false.

Constraints are limitations or restrictions that the architecture must operate within. These are non-negotiable and must be adhered to during design and implementation.


### Data Strategy
Develop a comprehensive data strategy that addresses:
- Data collection and preparation
- Data quality and diversity
- Privacy and security concerns
- Integration with existing data systems

Model Selection and Development:
Choose appropriate models based on your use cases. Consider factors such as:
- Self Hosted vs SaaS
- Open weight vs Open Source
- Input-Output: text-to-text?
- Number of models needed
- Number of calls/model
- Size
- Evaluation
- Context window: input, output
- Fine-tuning requirements
- Model performance and efficiency

### Infrastructure Design
Design a scalable and flexible infrastructure that can support GenAI workloads:
- Leverage cloud platforms for scalability and access to specialized hardware
- Implement a modular architecture to allow for easy updates and replacements of components
- Consider hybrid or multi-cloud approaches for optimal performance and cost-efficiency
### Integration and Deployment
Plan for seamless integration with existing systems and workflows:
- Develop APIs and interfaces for easy access to GenAI capabilities
- Implement CI/CD pipelines for model deployment and updates
- Ensure compatibility with legacy systems
### Monitoring and Optimization
Establish robust monitoring and optimization processes:
- Implement logging and telemetry for model performance
- Set up feedback loops for continuous improvement
- Develop KPIs to measure the business impact of GenAI solutions
- Depending on the location, set up billing alerts to monitoring usage over time
### Governance and Security
Implement strong governance and security measures:
- Develop policies for responsible AI use
- Implement access controls and data protection measures
- Ensure compliance with relevant regulations and industry standards
### Scalability and Future-Proofing
Design the architecture with scalability and future advancements in mind:
- Use containerization and microservices for flexibility
- Implement version control for models and data
- Plan for potential increases in computational requirements
